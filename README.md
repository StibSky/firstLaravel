This is my First Laravel project. 
I used online tutorials and documentation to get me started on Laravel.


The goal was to make a simple webpage with a form and a database connection.

I use a lot of includes to avoid duplicate code 
((see resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php))

In ((controllers/MessagesController.php)) I push to the database.

I used a basic migration that was generated and edited it to get the tables that I needed.

Expect more elaborate projects in the near future!
